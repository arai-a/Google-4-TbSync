# Google-4-TbSync

This provider add-on adds Google synchronization capabilities to TbSync. Only contacts are currently managed, using Google's People API.

The work is based on [EteSync4TbSync](https://github.com/etesync/EteSync-4-TbSync), [DAV4TbSync](https://github.com/jobisoft/DAV-4-TbSync) and advices by John Bieling himself.
